## Do stuff with the bootamir_apt.sh script

Intended to be run on a fresh Linux installation (apt package management).

Currently installs some stuff, configures git for me, and clones this repository and installs the install.sh script. Woohoo!

Missing: nodejs installation (but I hate JavaScript so maybe no), .bashrc customizations (git prompt, virtualenvwrapper,...). Note that maybe I added those and forgot to update this README.


## The install.sh script

It copies a lot of dotfiles from the nice folder into your `$HOME`. It's
basically a dotfiles repository in a different name - to confuse the enemy.

The `install.sh` script is supposed to symlink those files into the system
easily.  Basically only I am supposed to use this repo.


## The second paragraph

This is the second paragraph.
