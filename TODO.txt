I want to make a amirize.sh script that install EVERYTHING and not the nexe sh~t I did on master.

TODO:

[x] neovim install
    [x] clone repo
    [x] init.vim -> taken from vimrc or not? probably not
    [x] autoload vim-plug and auto install plugins
[ ] warn about ssh-key in github - can I check somehow manually instead of warning and Y/n?
[ ] How to ask for admin priviledges? hanging on sudo is not nice. Run stuff async and then run all sudo tasks together? What would I do with an Ansible script? What would Ansible users do? Provide password one time in playbook invocations? Mayeb I *should* consider converting all scripts to Ansible... of course have Ansible installed automatically as well.
[ ] Does node has to be installed globally? What about installing n and then installing node to ~/.npm-packages (configured via a script here)?
