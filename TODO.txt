I want to make a amirize.sh script that install EVERYTHING and not the nexe sh~t I did on master.

TODO:

[ ] neovim install
    [ ] clone repo
    [ ] init.vim -> taken from vimrc or not? probably not
    [ ] autoload vim-plug and auto install plugins
[ ] warn about ssh-key in github - can I check somehow manually instead of warning and Y/n?
